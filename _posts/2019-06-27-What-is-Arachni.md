# Arachni

## 1 Introduction:

Arachni is a feature-full, modular, high-performance Ruby framework aimed towards helping penetration testers and administrators evaluate the security of modern web applications.

### Recommended system requirements
Operating systems: Linux (32bit or 64bit), Mac OS X (64bit), Windows (64bit)
RAM: 2GB of available memory.
Storage: 10GB of available disk space.
Optional: PostgreSQL server for the WebUI â€” by default SQLite3 is used (included in the packages).
PostgreSQL is preferred when dealing with larger workloads, for configuration instructions please see the WebUI Wiki.
Prior to running scans, it is recommended that you consult the scan optimization guide, as there are several options you can use to significantly increase performance and/or limit resource utilization.
